# Timestamp Helper
Do you work with since-epoch timestamped data and constantly find yourself opening a browser tab to convert it to something you can read? Give these tools a try.

### Use cases:
* Your technology stack logs in timestamps and you're constantly having to convert the timestamps for reporting in organization docs, issues, tickets, etc.
* You ran an experiment where a device collected timestamped data, and you want to quickly be able to compare event timings against your hand-written notes, or your memory of the experiment.
* Your system is doing something strange, and you want to quickly check that it's operating in the same year as everyone else!

### Setup:

We're working on reducing dependencies, but since the original implementation needed to be quick for this to make any sense to work on, we took two shortcuts:
* `xsel` (available on brew and apt)
* `node` (available [here](https://nodejs.org/en/))
* [Optional] `jest` if you want to run the tests.
