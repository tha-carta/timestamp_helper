# Timestamp Helper
Do you work with since-epoch timestamped data and constantly find yourself opening a browser tab to convert it to something you can read? Give these tools a try.

### Use cases:
* Your technology stack logs in timestamps and you're constantly having to convert the timestamps for reporting in organization docs, issues, tickets, etc.
* You ran an experiment where a device collected timestamped data, and you want to quickly be able to compare event timings against your hand-written notes, or your memory of the experiment.
* Your system is doing something strange, and you want to quickly check that it's operating in the same year as everyone else!
